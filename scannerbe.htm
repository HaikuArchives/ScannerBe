<p>This is currently in beta, please look over the API and SDK and give me <a href="mailto:jbm@verinet.com">feedback</a>. Please do not release any products based on
the current documentation until version 1.0 is released. The SDK will not appear on <a href="http://www.be.com/beware/">BeWare</a> until it version 1.0 has been released.</p>

    <td width="78%"><em>ScannerBe is an API for applications that use image capture devices.
    In particular, it was designed for flatbed desktop scanners. By implementing the ScannerBe
    interface, an application can take advantage of multiple scanner makes and models without
    having to write scanner-dependent code. By writing a ScannerBe add-on, a scanner can be
    made available to these applications.</em></td>
